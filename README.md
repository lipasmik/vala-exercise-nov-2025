## VALA coding exercise: Multiplies (by Mikko Lipasti)

### To run the program:

Prerequisite: install python (if not installed)

Running the program: `python multiples.py <input_file> <output_file>`, e.g. `python multiples.py input.txt output.txt`. Input file structure should be similar as in `examples/numbers.txt` file.

### Improvement suggestions for future:

- Handling of combinations of user inputs with really small numbers to be multiplied (e.g. 1, 2) and a really large goal number (e.g. 1,000,000) in method process_multiples
- Improve handling of binary files as input (e.g. images etc)
- Unit tests (e.g. `pytest`) could be added
